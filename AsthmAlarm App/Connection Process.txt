As if no previous data has been collected - first time
User starts the application
it prompts them for the name of their network and the password
Then it tells them to plug in the Arduino to a usb prompts
Application runs function which:
    Checks COM ports for Arduino until it finds one
    Checks for 5 seconds:
        if COM port found, exit the loop and move one
        if not, notify the user that an Arduino can't be found on a COM port and keep checking

    create a serial with the COM port
    Send wifi information and wait for a response from the Arduino indicating that it can connect to the wifi

    If that response is received, set status to green and save the wifi information to a config file
    Prompt the user for the rate at which to send data:
    Send that over Serial, wait for response from Arduino
    If response received, give green light for Arduino to start connecting

Graphically:
Tkinter App Side                                    Arduino Side
                                                    Start Arduino
App start                                           Try to connect to wifi from FlashStorage - 3 attempts
20 second wait                                      if not successful, wait for Serial communication (Serial.available())
Pull up prompt
Collect SSID and pass ---;SSID:<ssid>,<pass>;-----> Collect information between the two semicolons
                                over Serial         try to connect to Wifi with this combination - 3 times
                                                    If still not successful, send message back saying ;ARD-DISCONNECT;
Wait for response from Arduino
